#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs involves understanding what users are trying to accomplish and why, not just what they explicitly ask for.

Understand the Problem: Use methods like interviews, surveys, observations, and analyzing existing systems to grasp the users' workflows, pain points, and goals. Ask "why" frequently (the 5 Whys technique) to get to the root need.

Define Requirements: Translate the gathered information into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) requirements. These fall into functional requirements (what the system must do) and non-functional requirements (qualities like performance, security, and usability).

Implement and Validate: Design and code the program based on these requirements. Continuously test and validate the implemented features with real users to ensure they truly solve the original problem and meet the needs.
